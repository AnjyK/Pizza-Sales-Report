# Pizza-Sales-Report

### Project Overview
Our objective is to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for pizza sales data to derive actionable insights into business performance. We aim to calculate various metrics to assess the overall performance of the pizza sales department. These metrics include:

1. Total Revenue: This metric represents the sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value: This metric indicates the average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.
3. Total Pizza Sold: This metric reflects the sum of quantities of all pizzas sold.
4. Total Orders: This metric denotes the total number of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: This metric measures the average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
   
### Data Sources

### Tools
- MS SQL 
- Csv
- Power BI

### Data Cleaning and Data Transformation
We standardized the size descriptions of the pizzas by transforming column values from "S," "M," "L," etc., to "Regular," "Medium," "Large," and so forth. Additionally, we extracted the day name from the order date column and implemented a conditional column setting to arrange it sequentially as Sunday, Monday, and so on. Moreover, we extracted the month name from the order date column and sorted it as January, February, and subsequent months. Furthermore, we created new columns to extract the first three letters from both the day name and month name, such as SUN, MON, and JAN, FEB, respectively, to facilitate data visualization for charts.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Determine the five key performance indicators (KPIs) outlined in the project description.
2. Analyze the daily trend based on the total number of orders placed.
3. Examine the monthly trend in relation to the total number of orders placed.
4. Calculate the percentage of sales for each pizza category.
5. Calculate the percentage of sales for each pizza size.
6. Determine the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
7. Identify the top five pizzas based on revenue.
8. Identify the top five pizzas based on quantity sold.
9. Identify the top five pizzas based on total orders placed.
10. Identify the bottom five pizzas based on revenue.
11. Identify the bottom five pizzas based on quantity sold.
12. Identify the bottom five pizzas based on total orders placed.
